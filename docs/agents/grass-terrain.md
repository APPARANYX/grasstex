## Grass & terrain (reference)

- `GrassAPI` (`grass-api.js`):
  - Masks: `addArea` / `excludeCircle|Box|Polygon|Corridor|Segment`.
  - Surfaces: `allowSurface` / `excludeSurface` + `setSurfaceResolver`.
  - Terrain: `setTerrainSampler` / `setTerrainMesh` / `setMaxSlope`.
  - Queries and rebuilds: `isAllowed`, `snapshot()`, `requestRebuild()`. Set `autoRebuild=false`
    for bulk edits.
  - Placement is deterministic per seed.
- **Invariant:** grass, shadows and the camera must sample *the rendered mesh* (or the same
  heightfield the mesh displaces from), never the analytic height. The gap was 0.41 m beside the road.
  - `sampleAt` interpolates the GPU's triangle: vertex `col+row*GRID`, z falls with row, split
    `(A,B,C)` if u≥v, else `(D,A,C)`.
  - With non-uniform columns, use the real column width, keep UVs world-linear in X, and use
    `Uint32Array` indices.
- Shadow decals tilt into the terrain tangent plane, and their alpha must reach 0 at `SHADOW_END`.
- `tools/terrain-bake/`:
  - `node genmap.js --seed 7` generates `map.svg`, with graded routed roads.
  - `node --max-old-space-size=4096 run.js` bakes the heightfield and splat, and `render.js` draws figures.
  - `lod.js` and `stream.js` do camera LOD with crack snapping and hysteresis.
  - `terrain-baked.js` feeds one field to both grass and mesh.
  - Known gap: its `ShaderMaterial` doesn't receive cascaded shadows.
